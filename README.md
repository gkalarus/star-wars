# Star Wars planet encyclopedia - Single Page Application

This app is a Star Wars planet encyclopedia. The application communicates with an open Star Wars REST API (https://swapi.co/). On the application load, all movies are fetched from the API and rendered as a collapsible elements on the list. The planets for a specific movie are fetched when the user expands the movie details. Users can also add new movies with planets of their choice. Tables are sortable by columns. The application is built based on the React.js library. For styling I have used SASS(SCSS) preprocessor.
